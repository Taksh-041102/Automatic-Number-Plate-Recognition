This project is a fully functioning automatic number plate recognition model with text extracion feature.

The dataset used for training was obtained from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection)

Tensorflow Object Detection API was utilized for the number plate recognition and EasyOCR module was used to extract the text from 
the detected plates.

A working snapshot of the model recognizing the plate is attached below.
